## Setting Up the Development Environment

To set up your development environment, you'll need to [install Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Once Conda is installed, you can create the environment with the following command:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```  
Once created, you can activate the environment with the following command:
```
conda activate kivy_app_env
```
## Running the app
Once the environment is activated & you're in the root folder, the following command will run the app
```
python -m app.main
```
